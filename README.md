## About The Snake Game

This is a simple snake game for windows console and linux console. It's written in C# and uses .NET 9

Snake eat food and grow. The game is over if the snake hits the wall or itself.

Food gives points.

- Food 🍎 gives 10 points.
- Food 🍌 gives 11 points.
- Food 🍒 gives 12 points.

Food is placed randomly on the board. Food size is more than one field so you have to cath the left side of the food to eat it.

The snake can move up, down, left and right.

The score is shown in the top.
